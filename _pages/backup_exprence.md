  <h3>Research Intern | Tsinghua University Lab</h3>
  <p><strong>Mar 2025 ‚Äì Present</strong> | Beijing, China</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Conducting research on intelligent mobility management in high-speed cellular networks (e.g., metro scenarios), aiming to enhance streaming experience by predicting network buffering events.</li>
    <li>Designed a cross-layer stalling prediction model using physical-layer signals (RSRP, SNR, PCI) and higher-layer metrics; achieved an F1-score of ~0.68 through feature selection and iterative model training.</li>
    <li>Performed real-world data analysis using CDF plots to identify signal fluctuation patterns during handovers, enabling proactive mitigation strategies.</li>
    <li>Deployed the model prototype on mobile devices, demonstrating reduced stalling frequency and duration compared to baseline approaches.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Core Member | Edge-Cloud Collaborative Deep Learning Inference Framework</h3>
  <p><strong>Dec 2023 ‚Äì Dec 2024</strong> | Chongqing University (Chongqing Municipal Innovation Program)</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Developed a dynamic model partitioning framework to reduce computation latency and energy consumption on edge devices by offloading partial inference to edge servers.</li>
    <li>Implemented and evaluated the system on diverse DNN architectures including AlexNet, ResNet, and YOLO, achieving improved throughput and lower end-to-end latency.</li>
    <li>Compared fixed vs. dynamic partitioning strategies; results showed significant speedup over pure edge-side inference.</li>
    <li>Contributed to a manuscript currently under preparation for submission.</li>
  </ul>
