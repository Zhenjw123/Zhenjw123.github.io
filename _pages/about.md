Hello! I am Jiawei Zhen, a fourth-year undergraduate student at Chongqing University, majoring in Computer Science and Technology. I am interested in computer network, deep learning, and artificial intelligence. 

There are few things in my homepage because I am still a freshman. I will update it as I learn more about myself and my research.
