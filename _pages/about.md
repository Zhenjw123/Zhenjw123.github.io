<span class='anchor' id='-about-me'></span>

Hello! I'm **Jiawei Zhen** (甄嘉炜), a fourth-year undergraduate student in **Computer Science and Technology** at **Chongqing University** (Class of 2026). I am passionate about **computer networks**, **deep learning**, and **artificial intelligence**, with hands-on experience in distributed systems, edge AI, and data-driven modeling.

<!-- I have been honored to be admitted to **Tsinghua University** for my postgraduate  studies in Software Engineering, starting in September 2026.  -->
My academic performance ranks in the **top 0.6%** of my cohort (GPA: 3.94/4.0), and I am a recipient of the **National Scholarship**, **Changjiang Electric Power Scholarship**, and multiple provincial-level awards in mathematics, programming, and mathematical modeling.

Through research projects and coursework, I have developed strong technical skills in **Python**, **C++**, **machine learning frameworks**, and **distributed computing platforms** (Hadoop, Spark). I am particularly interested in efficient deep learning inference, intelligent network systems, and scalable AI solutions.

This website serves as a record of my academic journey, projects, and technical explorations. While it's still evolving, I aim to keep sharing insights from my research, coding experiences, and learning process.
